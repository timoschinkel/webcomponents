# Webcomponents

An experiment in webcomponents. In this repository I want to answer the following questions:
- What is the best usecase for webcomponents?
- Should an abstraction be needed?
- How will forms and form components work within webcomponents.

## Development
Webcomponents are a JavaScript specification, so the main language for this repository is JavaScript. Usage of [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) is advised. I personally prefer TypeScript, and therefore the webcomponents are written using TypeScript.
